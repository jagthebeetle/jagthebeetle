## üôõ $\mathit{Chapter\ 1}$ üôô

At the trivium of empiricism, skepticism, and wonder,\
I trade code for coin and try to learn a thing or two a day,\
Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, pale Ramon.

## üôõ $\mathit{Chapter\ 2}$ üôô

I'm interested in linguistic aesthetics, and love neat correspondences between concepts mathematical, structural, and poetic.
One such is that between code and literature (just how well can the `former` fulfil the role of the ~letter~ latter?).
Or more broadly, how can code help one explain oneself to oneself, and, thereby, to others? (_¬øQuem ad finem sese effrenata iactabit technautopsychexegesis?_)

I enjoy denubilating the inenubilable, even when 'tis futile, and I think the word "literally," being etymologically metaphoric ("of the letter"),
need not be taken literally literally.

## üôõ $\mathit{Chapter\ 3}$ üôô

More concretely, I maintain a TypeScript web app at Google used to view CI/CD results within _the firm_, with a focus on clientside matters and the
end-to-end path back to frontend infrastructure. I enjoy troubleshooting and data analysis, especially when I can bring spreadsheets, bash, SQL, and
JavaScript to bear in Frankensteinian, or Thesean, ways.

Satellitically, but still technologically, I crawl through data visualization, $\mathbb{R}^n$, for $n>3$, (group-theoretic) symmetry, machine learning,
and statistics.

Exoplanetically, which is to say, no longer technologically, I love words, play thereon, Old English, music, and TV dramas.
